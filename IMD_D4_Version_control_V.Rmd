#### Working with others

guidelines: same as working by yourself, plus: communicate with collaborators, don't delete or modify commits once you have pushed them (more on this later)

Overview diagram

##### Branching - same as before.

Both: Make a new branch and switch to it

##### Staging and committing - same as before.

Each: Make a different file
Each: Stage and commit
Each: Push branch

##### Ignoring files in Git

You'll usually have files in your project that you don't want to include in its permanent history. This could include things like data, database connection information, or user-specific configuration files.
Depending on the situation, you also may want to avoid tracking files generated by your code, since you can just recreate an up to date version of these files by rerunning your code.

This is where the `.gitignore` file comes in handy. Open it up, and on a new line add the name of the file or folder you want Git to ignore. You can also use a [regular expression]() to specify multiple filenames matching a certain pattern. It will take effect when you save `.gitignore` but you may need to click the refresh icon in the top right of the **Git** tab to see the files disappear from the status view.

**WARNING:** If you accidentally commit sensitive information, deleting it and/or adding the file to `.gitignore` is not enough! The information will still exist in your commit history. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) for information on how to handle this situation.

##### Pulling part I

Pull = fetch (get changes) + merge (incorporate them with your stuff). When you are on a branch, pulling retrieves the remote (GitHub) version of that branch and merges it into your local version.

Collab 1: Pull main, pull own branch in case collab 2 made any changes

##### Pushing to GitHub - collaborative version
Don't push main to a shared GitHub repo!

Push your branch + create pull request in GitHub

##### Pull requests

NOTE: pull request != pull. You are asking your collaborator to pull your branch, review it, and then merge it into main if all looks good. Why isn't it called a merge request? Because sometimes you just want feedback on your code and aren't ready to merge it into main

Collab 2: Review pull request, merge into main

##### Pulling part II

Collab 2: Now main has new commits that we don't have locally. Make sure that everything works with our code by merging from main, then push our branch and do a pull request. Collab 1 will review and merge into main.

Rinse and repeat
