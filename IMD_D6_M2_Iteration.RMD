####Iterative functions vs iterating a function
A two part system. 
-You have something you want to do many times. This is your function. 
-You need some way to do it many times, that is your iterative function. 

Examples
for() and stuff

####Iterative functions
#How different iteration tools handle / parse your data and pass it to functions - what is in x and 

#more in-depth look at iteration options?
#vectorization
#if/else, while
#for
#apply family
#do.call
#purr family

####Simple Iteration
#use the function we modify to do something
#example using map family should operate on one dataframe to get started

####Best Practices:Iteration
#When to start looking for a different way to iterate? 
  When you are violating some aspect of Dry. 
  lots of times and each time is similar. 
#avoiding loops within loops within... when you can
#clear return statement
#commenting
#profiling for optimizing a more complex function


####performance and profiling - when to worry about it and where to look 
#system.time()
#microbenchmark
#profiler thing that gives you each step and how long it took?
