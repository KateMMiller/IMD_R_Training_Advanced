###February 8 - Day 6 2022 R Training for IMD Scientists' Meeting
#Functional Programming
#Iteration with functions, Vectorization, Best Practices

#this day is covering how to get a lot of repetitive tasks done quickly. The approaches below
#are intended to get you started, but are not exhaustive. There are many many more ways to accomplish
#your goals than what we present below.
#testing commits from NPS computer


####What is a function?
A function allows 
Everything is a function. But what is it really?
```{looking at a function, echo = F, eval=T}
#run these in the console without the () to see what lies underneath
mean

lm

```
So R functions are basically made up of a little bit of code an some more functions....


####When do you need a function?
-When you are recycling the same code and changing variable names or values.
#effectively it is a force QA/QC filter
#consistency - garbage in garbage out


####What should your function look like
readability is not trivial
naming a function and conventions
variable names
Understanding how you may encounter functions being represented in help - curly brackets vs no

####Steps for function develops
#setting test cases

####Modifying simple function
provide as an example the modification of mean to have na.rm=T

Create a plot function see day 4

####More complex functions

#multiple parameters
#defaults, overriding defaults
#ellipsis


#if/else, while switches - case specific operations

#customizing output
#summarizing into dataframe
#getting it to output that you want.





####Iterative functions vs iterating a function
A two part system. 
-You have something you want to do many times. This is your function. 
-You need some way to do it many times, that is your iterative function. 

Examples
for() and stuff




####Iterative functions
#How different iteration tools handle / parse your data and pass it to functions - what is in x and where
#does it come from?
###########################
#more in-depth look at iteration options?
#purr family
#apply family
#for
#if/else, while
#do.call
#and more...


####Simple Iteration
#use the function we modify to do something
#example using map or apply family should operate on one dataframe to get started



####vectorization
#...


####performance and profiling - when to worry about it and where to look 
#system.time()
#profiling for optimizing a more complex function


####Coding best practices
#avoiding loops within loops within... when you can
