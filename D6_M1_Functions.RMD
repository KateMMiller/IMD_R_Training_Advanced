####Overview

###February 8 - Day 6 2022 R Training for IMD Scientists' Meeting
#Functional Programming
#Iteration with functions, Vectorization, Best Practices

#this day is covering how to get a lot of repetitive tasks done quickly. The approaches below
#are intended to get you started, but are not exhaustive. There are many many more ways to accomplish
#your goals than what we present below.
#testing commits from NPS computer


####What is a function?
#JP+Thomas

A function allows 
Everything is a function. But what is it really?
```{looking at a function, echo = F, eval=T}
#run these in the console without the () to see what lies underneath
mean

lm

```
So R functions are basically made up of a little bit of code an some more functions....


####When do you need a function? 
#Thomas

-When you are recycling the same code and changing variable names or values.
#effectively it is a force QA/QC filter
#consistency - garbage in garbage out


####Best Practices: What should your function look like
#1 function for each task vs 1 function to rule them all
readability is not trivial
naming a function and conventions
variable names
Understanding how you may encounter functions being represented in help - curly brackets vs no
organization of the function

####Steps for function development
#setting test cases

####Modifying simple function
provide as an example the modification of mean to have na.rm=T

Create a plot function see day 4

####More complex functions

#multiple parameters
#defaults, overriding defaults
#ellipsis


####Defining the output of functions
#depends on how you plan on using the function
#customizing output
#summarizing into dataframe
#getting it to output that you want.

####Best Practices: outputs
#variable names
  #keep argument names the same
#planning ahead - where does it go next?
#Think about what makes sense so the piping works well?
