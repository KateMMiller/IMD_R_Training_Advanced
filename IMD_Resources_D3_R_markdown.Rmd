<h6>R Markdown</h6>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/">R Markdown: The Definitive Guide</a>. This is Yihui Xie's book that's available free online and for purchase. Yihui is one of the main developers at RStudio working on R Markdown and related packages (e.g. knitr, pagedown, bookdown). The online book is searchable, and is often the first place I check, when I can't remember how to do something.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/">R Markdown Cookbook</a>. Another great book with Yihui Xie as an author. This book is free online and has a lot of small bite-size tips for customizing R Markdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, chapters 27 and 29. The book itself is worth a read cover to cover. The chapters on R Markdown are also very helpful on their own.</li>

<h6>HTML/CSS</h6>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 Schools HTML page:</a> This website includes helpful tutorials on HTML and CSS, includes executable examples for just about every HTML tag you can think of, and shows how different browsers render content.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML & CSS design and build websites:</a> This book costs about $15 (cheaper if you can find a used copy) and was a very helpful introduction and continual resource, particularly for working with CSS. There's a Javascript & JQuery book by the same author that's equally well-done, but was a much steeper learning curve.</li>
</ul>

<h6>LaTeX</h6>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ctan.org/">CTAN.org:</a> This is LaTeX's version of CRAN. </li>
